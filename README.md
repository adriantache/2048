# 2048
_A 2048 clone before I watch the Coding Train video on the topic_

One evening, I was watching a great show on YouTube called [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) 
and the topic of the coding challenge was 2048. And this lead me to think that hey, I can make that myself! So 
I started to code this 2048 clone and here it is. 

After most features were done I also had a look at the [Coding Train 2048 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSn-DJU8qf0) and was surprised to see that some features \
were implemented more cleverly in my code. I've still got a few features to flesh out and I'm sure I can still improve
parts of the app that are already there.

**Please try out the app and report any bugs.**
